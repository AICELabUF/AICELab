			<div class=detail-title>Learning Analytics in Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra </div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Introduction</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Virtual Math Teams with Geogebra (VMTwG) is a 5-year 1.7 million project funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). VMTwG is collaborative among three institutions: University of Missouri-Columbia, Drexel University, and Rutgers University. VMTwG is to design, develop, and test a cutting-edge online collaborative learning environment where students and teachers solve mathematical problems and communicate their thinking with others.</p>

			<div class=detail-intro>My Role</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p> I am deeply involved and serve as the <span class=detail-em-text>student lead of the analytics team</span>(1 undergraduate, 1 master student, and 1 junior PhD student) in VMTwG project for the past 3 years. VMTwG system allows for small group interactions among students by breaking larger classes into small teams. In this, however, it becomes difficult for teachers to be able to personally guide and facilitate collaboration between students in a timely manner when facilitation would mean observing and responding to multiple groups of students each working at the same time but in different activity spaces. Using only the electronic trace data (automatically logged by VMTwG), I proposed a methodology combined activity theory, group cognition, complexity theory with computational modeling for an automated and meaningfully grounded assessment of student and group performance, It can also predict student and group performance before the collaboration ends. This analytics tool enables teachers to offer timely, concrete, and personalized help to students.</p>

I am the lead designer and developer for the learning analytics system to provide in-game assessment and feedback to students and enable teachers to monitor and provide intervention as needed. Particularly, relying on text reply technique, I proposed a video-text data replay method, linking video data to student digital trace data. This linkage provided the ground for me to build an automatic mental model tracing mechanism for students’ understanding of the water systems. While the MHS and the learning analytics system are still under development, some of the preliminary results are presented here. </p>

			<div class=detail-intro>My Role</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>I joint iSocial in its very early stage in 2010, under the mentorship of a postdoctoral fellow <a target='_blank' href='https://sites.google.com/site/matthewmschmidtshomepage/home' > Matthew Schimdt </a>, who is a now an assistant professor at University of Hawaii. I was deeply involved in this project throughout and particularly in video data analysis using<a target='_blank' href='https://tla.mpi.nl/tools/tla-tools/elan/'> ELAN </a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm'>ScreenFlow </a>;  user experience research with various methods; through a case study, we also examined the embodied social presence of youth with autism in 3D CVLE. </p>
			    <p>Specifically, we explored 11 youth with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) experience of embodied social presence while learning social competence in a 3D CVLE-iSocial. Using the developed embodied social presence development framework, we described youth with ASD levels of embodied presence, embodied copresence, and embodied social presence and how the various design features (narratives, choosing roles, fantasy settings and ease of use of learning tools) influence the experience of embodied social presence while learning in 3D CVLE. </p>

			<div class=detail-title>Semantic Visual Analytics for Online Discussion Forums </div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Introduction</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p> Discussion communities are a unique and important resource for seeking information and retrieving knowledge. Working with a collaborator <a target='_blank' href='http://cas.msu.edu/people/faculty-staff/staff-listing/name/joshua-introne/'>Josh Introne </a>, assistant professor in the Department of Media and Information, Michigan State University, we focuse on making discussion forum knowledge and information more accessible and findable for a broader audience. To explore these aims, we developed a topic tracing mechanism, which looks across forums to show how many topics are being discussed, what they are, and where these topics are located in the forums.</p>
			<img src='img/projects/project2-2-2.png'>
			<p>Topic tracing workflow: After preprocessing the forum data, posts are randomly sampled for human coders to develop training data for uninformative post removal. A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated via Kappa statistic and is finally applied to the whole dataset for this removal task. Next, common ingroup identity theory is operationalized to model forum user behavior for computing topic similarity among threads through thread vectorization, principle component analysis (PCA) and clustering. Last, latent Dirichelt allocation (LDA) is employed for semantic modeling to retrieve coherent topics and then visualized to provide dynamic support to the users.</p>
			</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Common Ingroup Identity Theory Informed User Modeling </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>One major difference between discussion data and static web documents is that discussion data is composed by different community users. It is natural to utilize user information for topic analysis of discussions. Particularly, the common ingroup identity theory inspires us on how to link topics of textual information with user behavior information.  Then we coded various topic modeling mechanisms to organize the discussion forum information. </p>
			</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Semantic Visual Analytics System </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>We crawled data with 70,950 unique posts, 8,820 threads and 5,589 posters from 2009 to 2014. By operationalizing common ingroup identity theory in a computational model, this study proposed an automated mechanism that modeled both user behavior and textual information to organize discussion forum data by topical structure and enable the users to locate useful information effectively. Specifically, our proposed model offers topic tracing and detection to address how many topics are being discussed, what they are and where they are (which topics are covered by each thread). We are currently seeking to update the analytics system to also include the topic structure or relationships between topics in the system. Some visulizations are presented below.  </p>

				<p>Collaborating with <a href='http://meefen.github.io/' target='_blank'>Bodong Chen </a>, assistant professor in Learning Technologies at the University of Minnesota and <a target='_blank' href='http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~chen654/'>Xin Chen</a>, PhD candidate in Engineering Education at Purdue University, we aim to uncover new insights about the learning analytics community by analyzing Twitter archives from the past four Learning Analytics and Knowledge (LAK) conferences. </p>
				<p>Through descriptive analysis, interaction network analysis, hashtag analysis, and topic modeling of 10,736 tweets by 1,217 unique Twitter users, we found: extended coverage of the community over the years; increasing interactions among its members regard less of peripheral and in-persistent participation; increasingly dense, connected and balanced social networks; and more and more diverse research topics. </p>

			<div class=detail-intro>Yammer </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Collaborating with <a href='https://www.ed.psu.edu/directory/mbs15' target='_blank'>Marcela Borge </a>, assistant professor in Learning Sciences at Penn State University, we evaluated a theoretically informed approach to using Social Media (Yammer) as a means to support the development of a community of learners in an introductory human computer interaction course. </p>
				<p>Our primary design goals were (1) to use the social media environment to help develop a learning community that lived outside of and yet fed into the classroom environment and (2) to connect classroom to real world experiences in ways that students could explore in personally meaningful ways. We hypothesized that we could create opportunities for collective sense-making and reflection through these connected experiences. Social network, communication analysis, and multivariate analysis were used to examine the form and function of social interactions in Yammer. </p>

				<p>Relying on multivariate analysis, social network analysis and qualitative communication analysis, the results suggest that the theoretically informed approach to using Yammer succeeded in encouraging processes associated with a community of learners. The methods used in this paper may contribute to more effective ways of assessing the quality of discourse in socio-technical environments and the findings provide potential models for using social media as new contexts for developing conceptualization and discourse practices. </p>

			<div class=detail-title>Reaching the Low Hanging Fruit in MOOCs</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Introduction</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Massive open online courses (MOOCs) recently move into the center stage of the discourse. While MOOCs demonstrate the potential of using Internet to make education available to a broader base, the high number of enrollment and dropout for each course raise methodological difficulties for instructors to identify at-risk students and provide in-time interventions. To some extent, scaling up learning in MOOCs can be considered as a sacrifice of pedagogical support. It is almost impossible to offer the same support quality in a class of five thousand as in a class of fifty.</p>
				<p>Although a major portion of participants dropping out either are unable to engage in the course activities at all or dropping out after the first week of participation, a large fraction of participants persist in the course longer but then drop out along the way. It suggests that there are learners who are struggling to stay involved. Identifying this particular portion of struggling students and supporting their participation may become the first low hanging fruit to enhance the success of the MOOCs. </p>

			<div class=detail-intro>Temporal Modeling and Ensemble Approach </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>We focused on a course named Project Management launched in August, 2014 hosted by Canvas. This was an eight-week course with 11 modules and 3,617 students for this course. I propose a temporal prediction model using ensemble machine learning methods that aims to accurately and reliably identify the struggling students in MOOCs in advance so that teachers can provide timely and quality pedagogical support to harvest these low hanging fruit of MOOC participants. Specifically, we design a temporal modeling approach, which prioritizes the at-risk students in a chronical order so that instructors can deal with the subset of at-risk students instead of all of them. This may improve the quality of intervention or support instructors offer. Moreover, we proffer appending historical features into the current week of features for model building and introduce principle component analysis to identify the breakpoint for turning off the features of previous weeks. This modeling method outperforms the approach model by summed features. To deal with the data variability, this study presents an ensemble stacking generalization approach to build more robust and accurate prediction models than the directly application of base learners.</p>

			<div class=detail-title>Automatic Student Off-task Behavior Detection</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Introduction</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Off-task behaviors have significant negative impact on student performance and learning outcomes. Therefore, it is important to detect the off-task behavior and design an effective way to reduce it. In current school curricula, it is the full responsibility of teachers to detect and respond to students' off-tasking. Granted teachers can detect off-task behavior easily, it is still impossible for them to observe and interact with every student at the same time and also challenging to implement scalable interventions to diminish constantly happening off-task behavior in a classroom full of students. </p>
				<p>One possible way to solve the problem is to detect off-task behavior using data from students' interaction with the learning system. Such a detector can be built into the learning system and discretely signal off-task behaviors in real time. In turn it has the potential to improve students' learning experiences and outcomes.  </p>
			</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Context </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>In our project, we attempt to detect off-task behavior in the context of the intelligent tutor system ASSISTments. ASSISTments is a web-based platform for tutoring K-12 school mathematics, which provides scaffolding, help and feedback as students complete math problems. ASSISTments decomposes a problem into steps. Hints are provided for each step and students can ask for a bottom-out hint that shows the final answer.</p>

			<div class=detail-intro>My Role</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Informed by social cognitive learning theory, I build a model to automatically detect students' off-task behavior while they are interacting with the system. More importantly, the built model only used the data available in the log files; therefore, the model does not require any sophisticated equipment (e.g. cameras, eye-trackers) that are inaccessible to most schools for student off-task behavior detection.  The proposed method increases the explained variance for the students and the resulting measures such as precision, recall, and F-measure all show enhancements. </p>

			<div class=detail-title>Dynamic CSCL Model of Learning</div>
			<div class=detail-intro>Introduction</div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>Researchers have taken considerable effort to understand the factors affecting student achievement in computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Previous studies, however, have investigated these factors from more or less isolated perspectives. We propose and validate a model of learning that sheds light on dynamics across several factors that are particularly understudied in CSCL. </p>
			    <p>Social cognitive theory relies on the premise of triadic reciprocal causation, which shows that cognitive factors, environmental factors and human behavioral factors interact with and influence each other. Based on social Cognitive Theory, we proposed two dynamic models of learning.  </p>

			<div class=detail-intro>Methods </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>PLS method is a multivariate statistical modeling technique used to test the relationships between a set of independent variables and dependent variables. The PLS measurement model was assessed by evaluating the reliability, internal consistency, convergent validity and discriminant validity through a confirmatory factor analysis. We further examined indirect, mediation effects in these two models using mediation analysis. </p>
			<div class=detail-intro>Modeling Results  </div>
			<div class=reveal-detail>
				<p>The findings show that dynamics among these factors are far more complex than previously reported. The current study enriches literature on student learning in CSCL in general and in particularly by providing new insights into influencing mechanism of these factors on student collaboration and performance. Methodologically, this study took advantage of the advancement of information systems (e.g. Sakai or other learning management systems) by modeling student social interaction using electronic trace data informed by the network theory. Our study demonstrates a potential approach to measure the constructs in CSCL studies and possibly with more validity and objectivity. </p>

				<p>I was the Web Master for <a target='_blank' href='http://ielab.missouri.edu/#/lab/home' target='_blank'>MU Information Experience Laboratory </a>and <a target='_blank' href='http://mizzou.orgsync.com/org/asist/home' target='_blank'>MU Student ASIS&T Chapter </a> from Jan, 2013 to May, 2014. My work involves design, maintenance, and update of the websites.  I also designed an analytics system for <a target='_blank' href='https://ethemes.missouri.edu/' target='_blank'>eThemes</a>, an educational resource system, to facilitate web management. </p>
			    <p>Specifically, we aim to provide an accurate and informative analysis from both temporal and geospatial perspectives via clustering and Geographic Information System (GIS) application using Google Analytics data. I first compensated Google Analytics data with social economic data and geographic data to present a comprehensive picture of website usage. In addition to clustering and statistical analysis for these data, I employed GIS to visually and geographically analyzing these data to examine and assess the web system usage. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to help web managers better examine the temporal effect on users’ visiting patterns based on accurate mathematical computation as well as provides more geographical insight into website performance through the constructed density measure and 3D graphic presentation. By offering in-depth quantitative information relying on mining data from web logs, such analytics system can help web stakeholders make better decisions on how to maintain and improve the websites, especially adjusting resources by considering temporal fluctuations and inequity in geographical distribution.  </p>
